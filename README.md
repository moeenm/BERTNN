# BERTNN: Affective Meaning Estimation for Everyone

## Introduction to BERTNN

Welcome to the world of BERTNN, a tool that estimates affective meanings in language! Designed for researchers, educators, and enthusiasts, BERTNN harnesses the power of advanced natural language processing to explore the emotional dimensions of words and phrases. Whether you're delving into sociology, psychology, linguistics, or just curious about language, BERTNN offers a user-friendly gateway to understanding affective meanings.

## No Programming Experience? No Problem!

Don't worry if you're not familiar with programming! We've prepared an easy-to-use platform where you can experiment with BERTNN without writing a single line of code. 

- **Google Colab**: A free, cloud-based platform that allows you to run BERTNN directly in your browser. [Access BERTNN on Google Colab]([https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ej1wldgDgjOOu2OBf3xXasq51L6V-gft?usp=sharing#scrollTo=o4b02VADlYT0))
- **Alternative Cloud Platform**: For those who prefer a different environment, we also provide access on another cloud platform. [Access BERTNN on Alternative Cloud Platform](#)

Both platforms come with pre-installed libraries and environments, making it hassle-free for you to start exploring affective meanings right away.

## Getting Started

Once you're on Google Colab or the alternative cloud platform, you'll find a Jupyter notebook pre-loaded with BERTNN. This notebook is your interactive guide, walking you through the process step-by-step.

1. **Run the Notebook**: Simply click "Runtime" on the top menu and select "Run all." The notebook will execute all the commands automatically.
2. **Explore Functions**: Use functions like `EPA_sents()` and `get_output_new()` to estimate the affective meanings of words and phrases in different contexts.
3. **Examples and Guidance**: The notebook includes examples and detailed explanations to help you understand how to use these functions.
