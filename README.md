# BERTNN: Affective Meaning Estimation for Everyone

## Introduction to BERTNN

Welcome to the world of BERTNN, a tool developed by Moeen Mostafavi, Michael D. Porter, and Dawn T. Robinson for estimating affective meanings in language. BERTNN harnesses advanced natural language processing techniques to explore the emotional dimensions of words and phrases, making it a valuable resource for researchers, educators, and anyone interested in the intersection of language and emotion.

### Abstract

This Jupyter-notebook file briefly reviews how the BERTNN model can estimate affective meanings. This is an ongoing project, and many parts may be changed in the final draft. This draft is for personal use. Please get in touch with the authors if you need to share it with your collaborators.

## No Programming Experience? No Problem!

You don't need any programming background to use BERTNN. We've set up a user-friendly platform on Google Colab, allowing you to experiment with BERTNN without any coding.

- **Google Colab**: [Access BERTNN on Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ej1wldgDgjOOu2OBf3xXasq51L6V-gft?usp=sharing#scrollTo=o4b02VADlYT0)
- **Note**: We recommend logging in with your personal Google account, as university or work accounts may not support all features.

- **Google Cloud**: [Access BERTNN on Google Cloud](http://34.125.8.52:8888/notebooks/MABMO_API.ipynb)
- **Note**: Use this token: d41135beb05ff3a5d79e676cfd2ba897350101722fcdd05f


Both platforms come with pre-installed libraries and environments, making it easy for you to start exploring affective meanings immediately.

## Getting Started

1. **Run the Notebook**: Simply click "Runtime" on the top menu and select "Run all."
2. **Explore Functions**: Use functions like `EPA_sents()` and `get_output_new()` for affective meanings estimation.
3. **Examples and Guidance**: The notebook includes examples and detailed explanations.
